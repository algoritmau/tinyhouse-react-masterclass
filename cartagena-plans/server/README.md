## Connecting the server to the MongoDB database

We will use the [MongoDB Node Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/) to connect our application to MongoDB and work with our data using the official Node.js driver. The driver features an asynchronous API that we can use to access method return values through Promises or specify callbacks to access them when communicating with MongoDB.

Install the driver:

```npm
npm install mongodb
```

Create a the file `database/index.ts` in the `src` directory and the following code:

```ts

```
